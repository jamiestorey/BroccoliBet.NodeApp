# BroccoliBet.NodeApp

This is uninished betting site that I'm working on.
It's the first web site I'm working on since taking a break from programming a few years ago.
I'm using this project to learn web development again.
I've been writing about my experience every day on my blog:
https://jamiestorey.dev/development-diary/start/

It's not for real bets, only frinedly bets between friends.

The bets are for every football game in the Premier Leauge and Leauge One

There are already deidcated apps available but they either don't allow betting on League One Games
or limit the number of games you can bet on in each round.

The idea is you guess the score for each game and are awarded points based on the outcome of the game.

+ Correct Score = 4 Points
+ Correct Team Won = 2 Points
+ Wrong Team won = 0 Points
+ Guessed a draw but not a draw = 0 Points
+ Guessed a draw and is a draw but wrong score = 1 Points

Whoever has the most points at the end of the Leauge wins.

## Credits:
To speed up the development of the site I followed a tutorial video to create a CRUD app with Google Authentication.
The link to the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY&t=1s

And the course has a repo here:
